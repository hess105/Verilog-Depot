## Introduction

Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used for designing and simulating digital circuits. It is widely used in the field of digital design, FPGA programming, and ASIC development. This repository aims to provide a curated collection of Verilog projects that can serve as educational resources, reference implementations, or starting points for your own designs. A majority of these programs are designed to run on a simulation provided by Purdue Univeristy provided here: [https://verilog.ecn.purdue.edu/].

## Projects List

Below is a list of projects included in this repository:

1. **Binary to 7-Segment Display Converter**: A Verilog module that takes a 3-digit binary input and converts it into signals to drive a 7-segment display.
